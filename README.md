# Healthcare-Management-System
Django + MongoDB based healthcare patient management system
I built this using Django for backend, MongoDB for database, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend.
This system allows hospitals or clinics to manage patient records, perform CRUD operations, and analyze data with a secure login system.
